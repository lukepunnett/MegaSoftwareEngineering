A Mega Collection of core software engineering notes

To become a software engineer, the list of topics to be mastered is ever growing. This is my personal collection of notes that enabled me to become a full-stack Java based developer. 

I am strong believer that 20% of a technology allows users in the normal enterpise environment and so this collection will place rightful emphasis on this core. It will however endeavour to cover as much as possible to the remaining 80%, so engineers can have a solid understanding of the intricacies of these technologies.
